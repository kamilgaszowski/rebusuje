# Rebusuje 
## Probably the best rebus site on the internet


## Info

[Rebusuje.pl](www.rebusuje.pl) is a simple web application with the ability to view and resolve rebuses.
The author of all rebuses is my friend Jarosław Miś.

Thanks to the work on this site, I have consolidated my knowledge in the field of web development and Jarek can finally show off his creativity to the world, and users, I hope, will have a lot of fun.

If you see any bugs, have an idea for new features, or think that existing features need improvement, write to me!
